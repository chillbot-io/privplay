## Executive Summary

| Metric | Strict | Exact | Partial | Type |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|------|
| **Precision** | 10.6% | 11.4% | 13.2% | 12.8% |

| **F1** | 18.1% | 19.5% | 22.6% | 21.9% |

### Evaluation Mode Definitions

- **Strict**: Exact boundary match AND exact type match (most conservative)
- **Exact**: Exact boundary match, entity type ignored
- **Partial**: Partial boundary overlap (0.5 credit), type must match
- **Type (ent_type)**: Entity type must match, boundaries can partially overlap

## Methodology Notes

### SemEval 2013 Task 9

This evaluation follows the methodology defined in:

> Segura-Bedmar, I., Martínez, P., & Herrero-Zazo, M. (2013). *SemEval-2013 Task 9: Extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from Biomedical Texts (DDIExtraction 2013)*. In Proceedings of SemEval.

The evaluation considers entity-level (not token-level) matching with four scenarios:
1. **Strict**: Both boundaries and type must match exactly
2. **Exact**: Boundaries must match exactly, type ignored
3. **Partial**: Boundaries can overlap (partial credit), type must match  
4. **Type**: Type must match, boundaries can overlap

### Dataset

**AI4Privacy PII Masking 400K**: A large-scale PII detection benchmark containing
400k+ samples with 54 PII categories, created for privacy-preserving NLP research.
